its been about a month or so since ive written one of these notes  

just want to let anyone whos been reading these that i'm doing better.  

ive been working on myself lately. a lot.

i'm still working on finding myself. maybe i never will. but i'm becoming less and less dissatisfied with that.

i'm getting a psychiatrist appointment.  

i'm learning.  

> "Wait. Hold up. F--'s wrong with me? I can't leave me alone with me"  
> I'm like "who's this ----- and why do I fear him?"
> It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
> Wait. Hold up. Stop controlling me. I don't know who I'm supposed to be"  

...

> "Once you create a living space between you and your mind,  
> Between you and your body, this is the end of something.  
> Don't identify any thought as negative because it's just a thought.  
> Who told you it's negative?"
