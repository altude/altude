ive had enough of not being enough.

i feel responsible for most of the problems in my life

why?

because i don't think im enough to not take responsibility for them

i hate looking at who i was

because it wasnt enough

so i want to change

baby steps aren't enough

if i were hit by a bus tomorrow i want to be enough (see /last-week.md)

but

"enough"

isnt enough

"enough"

for some reason, isn't always up to me
