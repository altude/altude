funny how we all know we'd act different if we knew when we'd die  
and still do nothing about it.  

i mean, think about it. what would you do if you knew a nuke was going to drop right on your location in a week?  

call your parents?  
tell them you love them?  

why don't we do that anyways?  

because humans are weird.  

we think we're invincible when we feel like it  

then the most random stuff happens and we realize how weak the links in our system are

think about it  

what does it take to disable a city for a week?

hijacking two planes.  

it's easier than it sounds.  

the us can launch nukes with only two people.

two people.

two people.

good night.
