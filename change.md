"people change, even satan used to be an angel"  
` - remember this, nf`

the past three months have been some of the worst of my life.  
everything that's happened to me just came and hit me in the face.  

i engaged in non-suicidal self-harm.  
i thought about killing myself a lot.  
i isolated myself from all the people who probably could have saved me from doing those things.  

the past week i've had to reflect.  
thinking about what i'll write in this note.  

my whole middle school life i've been so focused on change.  
thinking about how to do it.  
saying i'll do it and trying but failing.  

i think i'm finally starting to come out of it.  

i need to make a commitment to myself.

so here's my commitment. number one.

 - If someone else kills me, it will be only after I put my life in front of others'
 - If I kill myself, it will be because it will truly be the only option
 - If I die because of natural causes, I **will** be happy with the life I lived
 - I will never become a selfish self-serving lifeless being

These are the only things I can promise to myself.  
i want to write so much more but i cant promise it  
i'll write more when i feel confident enough to  

i owe my life to the following people: 
 - my mom
 - my brother
 - NF
 - @avplu
 - yoe mase
 - god, i guess?

if youre in this list, thank you.

my suicide thoughts are mostly gone, but i have a feeling i'll be battling with them on and off for most of my life.  
it's too bad, but not sure what i expected.  
i'm getting a therapist.  
i'm going to get better.
