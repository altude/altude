you know being strong actually involves a lot of things  

sure you can bench a lot  

run a while  

be very good at something  

but it takes an entirely different strength to be determined  

and to fight against your own weaknesses  

it's probably the hardest thing to be strong at  

but just like any kind of strength you can ignore it  

tons of people don't lift weights  

they live their lives without working out  

without being strong, physically  

i get that  

but how people live their lives without being strong emotionally  

ignoring emotional strength  

i dont understand.
