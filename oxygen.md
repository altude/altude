breath in.  
breath out.  

no like actually.

do it.

you will be happy to know that you just contributed more co2 into the world

congrats! you're not eco-friendly.

but that's fine, because you're still alive.  

there's more than one kind of oxygen.  

"breathing doesn't mean you're alive  

i bag up all of my trash and walk out on my tightrope  

positive thoughts are my rivals  

tryna be on their side though  

should i feel comfortable? i don't  

this year i felt suicidal  

maybe next year ill do something different like talking to god more"
